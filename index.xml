      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/release-3-4-2.html</guid>
      <description>The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 3.4.2, a new patch release for the 3.4 LTS version with 6 new features, improvements and fixes.
The main reason we are releasing this version is that we compiled 3.4.1 with Java 11 which leads to issues as described in this Github issue. Although we already have a fix for this problem (see CAMEL-15309), we found that it would be safer to push out a release compiled with Java 8 so nobody gets affected by this or any similar problems.</description>

      <description>Camel and Camel Quarkus are typically used to create integration applications that run as long living processes, a.k.a. daemons or services. In this blog post, we are going to explain a slightly different use case: using Camel Quarkus in programs that exit by themselves after performing some desired tasks.
Where can this be useful? The enterprise is full of scheduled batch processing. Say, some system exports some sort of reports daily at 4 a.</description>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/05/CdcWithCamelAndDebezium/</guid>
      <description>Change Data Capture (CDC) is a well-established software design pattern for a system that monitors and captures data changes, so that other software can respond to those events.
Using a CDC engine like Debezium along with Camel integration framework, we can easily build data pipelines to bridge traditional data stores and new cloud-native event-driven architectures.
The advantages of CDC comparing to a simple poll-based or query-based process are:
 All changes captured: intermediary changes (updates, deletes) between two runs of the poll loop may be missed.</description>

Then comparing the memory usage of running the example in JVM mode vs native compiled with GraalVM. Then showing for the finale how to quickly run 100 instances of the example each on their own TCP port and how quick Camel are to startup and service the first requests faster than you can type and click.</description>

      <description>The Apache Camel community is excited to have such a great response and effort already put in by the Outreachy applicants. We are grateful to all that contributed with code, ideas, helping others and being a part of our community.
We received similar inquiries from several applicants, asking help with the timeline for the final application, intern selection criteria and similar. To help answer this and to be transparent to all involved, so each individual can reflect and make informed decisions, here are some of our thoughts.</description>

      <title>Apache Camel 2020 Release Schedule</title>
      <link>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/03/LTS-Release-Schedule/</link>

      <guid>https://camel.apache.org/blog/2020/03/LTS-Release-Schedule/</guid>
      <description>The Apache Camel project is moving to release schedule with Long Term Support (LTS) and non-LTS releases.
The plan is to have 2 yearly LTS releases and then non-LTS releases in between.
This allows the Camel project to innovate and move much faster in non-LTS releases.
And as well to offer production stable branches (LTS) where end users can stay on for a longer period of time and get CVEs and important/critical bug fixes only.</description>

      <description>In Camel 3.2.0 we&amp;rsquo;ll release the complete set of Camel AWS2 components. In Camel 3.1.0 we already have a bunch of AWS2 components living together with the original AWS components. The aim of this post is giving a full perspective of what will change for the end users and the roadmap for new features.
New components Except camel-aws-xray, which is a particular component needing much more work to be migrated, all the original AWS components have been migrated to AWS SDK v2.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re most interested to see talks that offer a learning experience to the attendees, so talks that present new parts of the Camel ecosystem (Camel K, Camel Quarkus, Camel Kafka Connector), talks showing off lessons learned, use cases, and visions on where software integration is heading in the future.</description>

      <description>Have you built a new great Web API for your product? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be wonderful to have it available as a part of the great Apache Camel component family? We would love it.
The community just released Camel 3 which is more modular, lightweight and already includes lots of components (300+) to quickly integrate various systems consuming or producing data. All of these components can be used with the same integration domain specific language (DSL) based on the famous Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working at the European Commission for the last 4 years as a Software Architect, working for a unit responsible for developing reusable components, and advocating open source software. In this context, we organized already a couple of Hackathons and Bug bounties open to all the open source communities.
In the team, we worked already a couple of times with Apache Camel, and I like the elegance and performance compared with other integration frameworks.</description>

      <description>The Apache Camel community introduces a new subproject in the ecosystem: Camel-Kafka-Connector. This project born as a PoC exploring the possibility of leveraging the Apache Camel components as Kafka source and sink connectors. The main idea behind the project is reusing the Camel Components&amp;rsquo; flexibility in a simple way, through a configuration file mixing Kafka Connect configuration and Camel route definitions and options.
What is Kafka Connect? It is an Apache Kafka&amp;rsquo;s framework that defines a standardized way to stream data in and out a kafka broker.</description>

In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>

      <description>The Camel team is busy working on the last set of work for Apache Camel 3. Today the 2nd release candidate was built and published on a staging repository for early adopters to give it a try.
As I am busy myself then I just wanted to write a short blog post to keep the community posted that Apache Camel 3 is on the way, and that we expect it to be released by end of this year (sometime in November or December).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 2.18.0 release which resolved over 500 issues. This is first release that requires Java 8 and comes with a much-improved Spring Boot support, and ships with numerous new features, improvements and bug fixes.
 Java DSL with experimental Java8 functional/lambda support. Check out the camel-example-java8. We love feedback on this DSL and expect to improved the API over the next couple of releases. The XSD schema for &amp;lt;camelContext&amp;gt; and its other configuration elements are now also documented (before it was only &amp;lt;routes&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;rests&amp;gt;).</description>
