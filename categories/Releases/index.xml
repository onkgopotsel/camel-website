      <description>Apache Camel K has made a lot of progress since its inception and we&amp;rsquo;re now proud to announce the 1.0 release. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard in the past months to add more awesome features to Camel K, but also to improve stability and performance. This post contains a list of cool stuff that you&amp;rsquo;ll find in the 1.0 GA release.
First of all, if you&amp;rsquo;re living under a rock and it&amp;rsquo;s the first time you hear about Camel K, you can read some introductory blog posts here (1 - introducing camel k, 2 - camel k on knative) or look at the Apache Camel website that contains a Camel K section with a lot of material that is automatically generated from the Github repository.</description>

      <description>Apache Camel 3 was released last thursday November 28th 2019, which also happens to be the day of the US Thanksgiving. This was not intentionally but we can say its a big thanks from us to the community with a brand new major version of Camel - this does not come often by. In fact, its 10 years since Camel 2 hit the streets. So this 3rd generation is long overdue.</description>
